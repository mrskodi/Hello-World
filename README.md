# Hello-World
My first repository! Hello World!
I am very excited that I have made my first repository on GitHub. Learning new technologies surely is fun!

I learnt a lot yesterday and am very happy with the progress that I have been making so far. 
Having the right attitude is so CRUCIAL! I cannot wait for the day when I upload my 1st real project from my desktop!
WAY TO GO!!! YES I CAN and YES I WILL!
